# ShootOFF

Howdy all,

I'm looking to get ShootOFF more turn key for the linux / ubuntu guys out there.  The scope of this install script is for the "common user" that may not have much interest in the inner workings of configuring ShootOFF on Ubuntu. This is for the folks that have that old box / laptop laying around that is a worthy candidate for a stand alone ShootOFF training system.  If there are any linux ladies or gents that wouldn't mind taking the time to step through this script and let me know if I'm making any major mistakes, I would appreciate it.

Project Outline: 
Phase 1: (ETA 20170217) Get the script working / tested.  Build into modules for easy maintenance
Phase 2: (ETA 20170301) Polish the installer with formatting and desktop shortcut creation
Phase 3: (ETA 20170401) Perhaps develop a GUI installer or a snap package?
